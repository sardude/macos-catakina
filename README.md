If you're using any other Mac
If you're not using a Mac with Apple silicon, you're using an Intel-based Mac. 
Press and release the power button to turn on your Mac.
Immediately after releasing the power button, press and hold one of these key combinations. If none of them work, review the guidelines for using startup-key combinations.
Command-R: When you press and hold these two keys at startup, macOS Recovery will offer the current version of the most recently installed macOS.
Option-Command-R: When you press and hold these three keys at startup, macOS Recovery might offer the latest macOS that is compatible with your Mac.
Shift-Option-Command-R: When you press and hold these four keys at startup, macOS Recovery might offer the macOS that came with your Mac, or the closest version still available. 
Keep holding the keys until you see an Apple logo or spinning globe.
You might be asked to select a Wi-Fi network or attach a network cable. To select a Wi-Fi network, use the Wi-Fi menu  in the upper-right corner of the screen.
If you're asked to select a user you know the password for, select the user. Then click Next and enter that user's administrator password, which is the password they use to log in to the Mac.


Key combinations for an Intel-based Mac
